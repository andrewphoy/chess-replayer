1. e4 $7 c5 $8 2. Nf3 $5 Nc6 $1 {John immediately improves over our Week 3 encounter.
He now intends to decline my Morra gambit with 3... d3, when Black has a much
more flexible structure than before, having not committed to e7-e6. He could
then adopt a Scheveningen, or a Dragon...} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 $6 {One question
mark for stupidity, and another for originality. As the informed few are well
aware, I only know how to play the Morra gambit, so I boldly, or foolishly,
head into unfamiliar territory. I would have gladly unleashed the unsound
Morra and lost a Pawn for nothing, but John is a dogmatic decliner and does
not want the free pawn, like so many of you these days. So instead, I planned
to sacrifice a pawn a little later for chaotic complications, on move 18 to be
exact.} Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 $5 {Some of you may want to know if this entire game was
prepared/memorized beforehand, and I will gladly answer. Since Grandmaster
Fedorowicz has not played the volatile Sveshnikov variation of the Sicilian
since 1991 in the database, I knew for sure going into the match that he would
surprise me with it, and therefore focused all of my pre-game energies on this
anti-positional yet dynamic defense. After 6...e5!?, Black creates gaping
holes on the key d6 and d5 squares, but sends my proud Knight packing for the
hills. If White wishes to keep up the initiative and secure the d5 square, he
must give up the Bishop pair. This is the strategic justification behind the
opening variation, a system Grandmaster Sveshnikov pushed upon the resistant
chess public until they finally appreciated the creativity of his radical idea.
Today, the Sveshnikov remains one of the most popular aggressive responses for
Black in the Open Sicilian.} 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 {I am fighting for control of
the d5 square, but my Knight is still badly offside.} a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7
10. Bxf6 Bxf6 {The battle lines have been drawn -- Black with his two Bishops
but backward d-pawn, and White with his strong centralized Knight. In the
coming moves, I will bring my sad a3 Knight to e3, where he will assist his
brother on d5.} 11. c3 O-O 12. Nc2 Bg5 13. a4 bxa4 14. Rxa4 a5 15. Bc4 Rb8 {
As all of these moves are logical, they have been played 100&#39;s of times over,
1112 in the database, to be precise. Now White has a choice. Should he
permanently defend his Pawn with b3, or tie his Rook down to the defense with
Ra2? Naturally b3 is the more common move, but Ra2 is a retreat of far
reaching beauty.} 16. Ra2 Kh8 {
Black aims to break with f5, so the King must sidestep the White Bishop.} 17.
Nce3 {But if Black strikes with f5 now, then after exf5 he will have to
recapture with the Bishop, and White&#39;s central Knights remain undisturbed.
Thus, Fedorowicz supports the f5 break with g6 first. Kasparov did the same in
2005, in the final year of his professional career, against Anand.} g6 18. h4
$1 {Ponomariov uncorked this deep sacrifice against Kramnik a month before
Kasparov&#39;s game against Anand, although it had appeared far earlier than that.
At a glance, the Pawn thrust looks extremely dubious, and as we move forward,
it only gets more and more ridiculous!} Bxh4 19. g3 Bg5 20. f4 $1 {
A King&#39;s gambit inside a Sveshnikov!} exf4 21. gxf4 Bh4+ 22. Kf1 f5 23. b4 $1 {
A King&#39;s, and now an Evans Gambit, inside a Sveshnikov. At last the idea of
Ra2 is revealed: starting at move 17, White spends five of the next six moves
clearing the path for his Queen&#39;s Rook to the Kingside by force! The coup
leads to a forced win.} fxe4 24. Rah2 g5 {Still all &quot;theory.&quot; Later in 2005,
Kramnik grew tired of defending the Black side, and took the reins for White
vs. Van Wely. After 25. b5 Ne5! Qd4 the position grew unclear, and although
White won, proving an objective advantage is far from obvious. GM Fedorowicz
was most definitely aware of these games.} 25. Ke2 $3 $18 {This adventurous
King walk, however, refutes the entire 17... g6 main line variation of the
Sveshnikov. The key to the solution, like a great chess problem, contains
multiple points: a) By unpinning the King, I threaten fxg5, ripping apart
Black&#39;s defenses) The threat of b5 now takes on even greater significance,
as Ne5 now simply hangs a piece c) Black has no immediate punishing counter
attack against White&#39;s showboating King, as axb4 axb4 opens up the a1-h8
diagonal for White&#39;s Queen to do her mischief. gxf4 is quickly met by Rxh4,
and the natural Bg4 is obviously impossible, as it hangs a piece. Fedorowicz
chooses the most logical defense, guarding his vulnerable h7 pawn with Rb7 and
giving the defense some air. However, the counter-intuitive Rf7 and Qf8,
lining up for a defense of the Black King and an attack on the f-file, is
actually Black&#39;s best try in this lost position.} Rb7 (25... Rf7 $1 26. b5 Qf8
$1 {White now must fear the f-line, as 27. fxg5?? Rf2! leads to ruin, and 27.
bxc6 Rb2 is another scary sight! But now, the final point of Ke2 appears, a
calm, dare I say, &quot;positional&quot; walk to the Queenside!} 27. Kd2 $1 {And Black&#39;s
creative counter measure fails. The position now degenerates into a wild wild
west shootout. Here are some bloody highlights:} Bd7 (27... gxf4 28. Rxh4 fxe3+
29. Kc1 $1 Ne5 30. Nf6 $1 {A triple barrel on h7!} Bf5 31. Qh5 $3 {A quadruple
barrel, and the decisive Qxh7 and mate in a few cannot be stopped without
catastrophic material loss.}) 28. Kc2 $1 {Stopping any Rb2 tricks once and for
all, and its open season on the Black King.} Nd8 29. fxg5 Bxg5 30. Qd4+ Kg8 31.
Rxh7 $1 {Rxh7 32. Ne7# would have pleased the crowd.}) 26. b5 $1 {Black has no
choice now but to sacrifice the Knight for dubious compensation. If he
retreats to a7 or b8 he gets mated brutally in multiple ways.} Ne5 (26... Nb8
27. Qd4+ Rg7 28. fxg5 $1 Bxg5 29. Rxh7+ Kg8 30. Nf6# (30. Ne7#) (30. Rxg7#) (
30. Qxg7#)) 27. fxe5 dxe5 28. Qb1 {Black still has a puncher&#39;s chance, and
after Rf4!?, sacrificing another exchange for three connected passed pawns and
open lines to my King, I would need extreme accuracy.} Qd6 (28... Rf4 $1 29.
Nxf4 exf4 30. Qxe4 $1 {Slicing through the jungle -- the only path to victory.}
Re7 (30... fxe3 31. Rd1 Qf8 32. Qe5+ Rg7 33. Rf1 Qd8 {and among a few wins,
Qd4 is simplest, and Rf7, allowing Qd2+, is mate in 15. I leave you to work
out why!}) 31. Rxh4 $1 {The artistic conclusion to crown the refutation.} Rxe4
(31... gxh4 32. Qxf4 $1 {
And I emerg from the chaos a full piece up while the attack still rages.}) 32.
Rxh7#) 29. Qxe4 Rbf7 30. Rxh4 $1 {This thematic exchange sacrifice clears the
path to the Black King at last, a trail White had been blazing through the
h-file since the 18th move.} gxh4 31. Rxh4 Rg7 32. Bd3 {While I thought that
25. Ke2!! was my original novelty, I received a shock when my teammate, FM
Griego, informed me that 25. Ke2 had been played once in a game of 2200&#39;s and
below, and in addition a few games of correspondence chess as well. I simply
did not believe him and lost a few dollars on a gentleman&#39;s bet. But please,
no one tell the Commissioner, as gambling is against league rules, and I do
not want to face suspension. I must confess, this is a very good way to make
money off me, as, like Tal said, &quot;I smoke, I drink, I gamble, I chase women,
but correspondence chess is one vice I do not have.&quot; If you would like to
immerse yourself in the theoretical debate and delve into abstract questions
like &quot;what is a novelty?&quot;, I refer you to the following message board: http://
